<h2 id="import-transactions">How To: Import Transactions</h2>
<p>
  The first step is to download your account activity from your online banking website.  Do this by using
  your web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer) to login to your bank's online
  banking website.
</p>
  <img class="help example" src="/images/help/account-download.png" title="Download Account Activity"/>
<p>
  Decide which accounts you'd like to include, then follow the following steps for each account:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the account.</li>
  <li>Select a time period.</li>
  <li>Select the download file format.<br/>
     Supported file types are "Microsoft Money", "Intuit Quicken", "Intuit Quickbooks", or "Simply Accounting".<br/>
     "CSV", "Excel" and "Spreadsheet" file types are not supported.</li>
  <li>Press the Download button.</li>
</ol>
<img class="help example" src="/images/help/import-files-selected.png" title="Import Account Activity"/>
<p>
  Repeat the above steps for each account and time period of interest.  Once you've downloaded the account
  activity for each account, import the corresponding files into {{applicationName}} as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using {{applicationName}} select "Import" from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Press the "Select Files..." button.</li>
  <li>Select all of the account activity files that you downloaded from the bank.  You can select multiple files at once.</li>
  <li>Press the "Open" button and then the "Import Files" button.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <h4>Tip: Importing Multiple Times</h4>
  <p>
    It's okay to import the same account activity multiple times.  {{applicationName}} will automatically
    detect that transactions have been previously imported and ignore duplicates.  This makes it easy
    to import account activity from the current month or statement more than once as the days go by
    to get the most up to date information without having to worry about duplicates.
  </p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <h4><i class="fa fa-lock fa-2x"></i> Did You Know: Encryption</h4>
  <p>
    Banking information is private, and we want to keep it that way!  By encrypting your data
    using strong encryption you're taking steps to ensure that it's safe from prying eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data imported into {{applicationName}} is encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption with Galois Counter Mode (GCM).
    The secret key is derrived using PKCS #5's PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function #2).
    The password is salted to prevent dictionary attacks against the key.  A random 16-byte initialization
    vector is applied to ensure that each encrypted message is unique.
  </p>
  <p>
      While encryption does not 100% guarantee data safety, strong encryption is the best known way to protect
      your data.
  </p>

<h2 id="categorize-transactions">How To: Categorize Transactions</h2>
<p>
  Categorizing transactions enables you to view your expenses and income for each category.
  To categorize transactions from your imported account activity, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using {{applicationName}} select "Transactions" from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Select any month having transactions that you'd like to categorize.</li>
  <li>For each transaction, hover over the "Category" column and click on the "Choose category..." link.</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate category, and
    <ul>
      <li>press the "This Transaction Only" button to apply the cateogory for the transaction, or</li>
      <li>edit the description as needed to match multiple transactions, and press the "Matching Transactions"
          button to apply the category to every transaction that matches the desription.
      </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
</ol>
<img class="help example" src="/images/help/transaction-category.png" title="Apply Category to Transaction"/>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <h4>Tip: Apply Category to Multiple Transactions</h4>
  <p>
    A category can be applied to every transaction that matches a description.  Edit the description
    text by removing unimportant information such as leading or trailing numbers.  For example, to
    categorize all transactions matching "HOME DEPOT" with a description of "HOME DEPOT #12355",
    remove "#12355" to leave a description of "HOME DEPOT".
  </p>
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <h4>Tip: Sorting Transactions</h4>
  <p>
    The transactions for any month can be sorted by date, category, income or expense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sorting transactions by category can help to find uncategorized transactions, and can help to
    provide an understanding of which transactions contribute to a specific category.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sorting transactions by expense can help in identifying the largest expenses.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="view-reports">How To: View Reports</h2>

  from the main menu.
